# Todo List (2024)

## TODO
- Test move generation: Calculate number of possible positions p after n moves; report p and run time for calculation.
- Save all moves made in chess game
- Information to save for each move: piece, position from, position to, piece captured (or empty), and result (check, checkmate, stalemate, or draw)
- Add castling
- Add pawn en passant
- Add pawn promotion to pieces other than Queen
- Define winner and loser or draw
- Record result and points: win (1), draw (0.5), loss (0)
- Define draw: insufficient material
- Define draw: threefold repetition
- Define draw: fifty-move rule
- Switch between king middle game and end game tables
- Write legal moves using chess notation
- Color the square for the computer's latest move
- For the previous move, color to and from squares yellow (shade based on light/dark square)
- For possible moves, use blue squares (shade based on light/dark square)
- Highlighting possible moves:
  Try using a green square for piece-to-move location, and
  try alternating shades of blue (light/dark based on board) for move locations.
- MakeMove() is used in play_vs_computer.py; it should also be used in play.py and auto_play.py
- Consider putting SetStateFromPieceState() at the end of PlacePiece()
- Should we create a "Rules" class that knows the state and current player
  and enforces valid moves?
- Make function to get "state" (values) from "piece_state" (objects)
- Make function to get legal checks (subset of legal moves)
- Make function to get legal checkmates (subset of legal moves)
- Consolidate redundant functions in state and piece classes
- Fix bug: When there is 1 legal move for black (computer), and white will checkmate black on the nxt move, the best evaluation is +INF. No legal move is chosen, and black does not move!

## DONE
- Plot position evaluation maps for each piece
- Fix plots: they are flipped over the horizontal axis
- Add title and z color scale to plots
- Create tools.py and move some function from board.py to tools.py
- Use standard chess piece images
- Load all piece images once on startup: this is probably more efficient!
